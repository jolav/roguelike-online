        Shit!
      </p>

      <p>
        What a headache. It's always the same when leaving the hibernation capsule. Resources are scarce in the
        vault, so the only option is to hibernate in turns.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's either that or go out into the wilderness to survive. Even without being able to open your eyes, you
        outline
        a smile.
        Going out
        into
        the wilderness, how can you even think about that, what a madness!
      </p>

      <p>

      </p>

      <p>
        What's that siren? It sounds like the reactor's core fusion alarm that supplies power to the vault. And why
        does everything smells like death and closed
      </p>

      <p>
        You're beginning to be able to open your eyes. Let's see what the hell is going on.
